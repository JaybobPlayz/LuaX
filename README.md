# Lua X
Hello there,
JaybobPlayz#9926 here!

Finally,
Lua X is out with the all and new UI + KrnlAPI DLL!
Now this means v1.2.0 is more stable than v1.1.0 and below.
I might come out with a custom DLL sometime soon,
but i might do that in either v1.3.0 or v1.4.0! :D

I'm glad that you've chosen my executor and I can't wait for the feedback,
this is my first executor but i promise to update the UI atleast once or more a month.
